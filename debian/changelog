python-django (0.95.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Brett Parker ]
  * New upstream minor release for security bugs:
    - http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2007/jan/21/0951/
      - Fixes a small security vulnerability in the script Django's
        internationalization system uses to compile translation files
        (changeset 4360 in the "0.95-bugfixes" branch).
      - fix for a bug in Django's authentication middleware which could cause
        apparent "caching" of a logged-in user (changeset 4361).
      - patch which disables debugging mode in the flup FastCGI package Django
        uses to launch its FastCGI server, which prevents tracebacks from
        bubbling up during production use (changeset 4363).
    Closes: #407786, #407607
  * Sets Recommends to python-psycopg and moves other database engines to
