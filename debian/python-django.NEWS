python-django (1.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Django 1.7 has a new feature to handle database schema upgrade called
  "migrations" which is incompatible with South (provided by
  python-django-south in Debian). If you have Django applications using
  South, make sure that you have applied all migrations prior to the
  upgrade (alternatively you can use a virtualenv running Django 1.6
  to run those migrations after the upgrade).

  Django 1.7 comes with many new features and some backwards incompatible
  changes. They are well documented in the Django documentation:
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/releases/1.7/
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/internals/deprecation/#deprecation-removed-in-1-7
